This web application allows users to create a shopping list where they can add items, mark them as purchased (turning them green) by clicking the item/clicking "mark all purchased" button for collective marking and clear the list. 

The mini-app is created using 3 web technologies which are: HTML for document structure , Javascript for interaction and CSS for styling.
